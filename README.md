# Flapp Goooo ~~~

This game is just some of my weekend project. It's also clone of the famous
Flappy Bird game developed in Go with Bindings for SDL2.

## Installation

You need to install first SDL2 and the SDL2 bindings for Go. To do so follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2).
It is quite easy to install on basically any platform.

You will also need to install [pkg-config](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config).

## Run

Just use commad `go build -i -race && ./flappy-gopher`

## Images, fonts, and stuffs

All the images used in this game are CC0 and obtained from [Clipart](https://openclipart.org/tags/flapping).
You can find atlernative birds in there, so you can mod the game!

The fonts are copied from https://github.com/deano2390/OpenFlappyBird.

The birds are downloaded from [here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&v=aYkxFbd6luY&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa3V0M05zcTFxUmxaekVKSXJTQmxUTWh3TnZKUXxBQ3Jtc0tuS0E2M0QwNUQ3X0ZPdDdZMENYNWQtd2lvQkpSNDhtZzgxZUpyNVptdFZVMDFGRHRYOEktYXVnVUFjdFpESTlZQmV2WnQ2bHBIcC10YThWWHlmTzd4SG1KWVQ0M3dHZnJJXy1sd1hOVlBvRnJnX2IzVQ%3D%3D&q=http%3A%2F%2Fopengameart.org%2Fcontent%2Ffree-game-asset-grumpy-flappy-bird-sprite-sheets)
